# Movie Recommendation Platform: Dockerization and Deployment Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks required to:
1. Dockerize all microservices
2. Deploy the application on Kubernetes
3. Host services on AWS S3
4. Integrate the APIs with the frontend application

## 1. Dockerization Tasks

### 1.1 Create Dockerfiles for Each Microservice
- [x] Create Dockerfile for User Service
- [x] Create Dockerfile for Movie Catalog Service  
- [x] Create Dockerfile for Review Service
- [x] Create Dockerfile for Recommendation Service
- [x] Create Dockerfile for API Gateway 
- [x] Create Dockerfile for Eureka Server 

### 1.2 Docker Compose Configuration
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml for local development/testing
- [x] Configure networking between services

## 2. Kubernetes Deployment Tasks

### 2.1 Kubernetes Configuration Files
- [x] Create Deployment YAML for each microservice
- [x] Create Service YAML for each microservice
- [x] Configure ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management

### 2.2 Kubernetes Setup
- [x] Set up service discovery
- [x] Configure load balancing
- [x] Implement health checks and readiness probes

## 3. AWS Integration Tasks

### 3.1 AWS Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Set up AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) or alternative
- [ ] Configure S3 buckets for hosting
- [ ] Set up IAM roles and permissions
- [ ] Configure AWS load balancer

### 3.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline to build Docker images
- [ ] Set up automated deployments to Kubernetes
- [ ] Configure AWS CodePipeline or alternative

### 3.3 S3 Integration
**Note:** S3 is typically used for static file hosting, not for running applications. 
Consider using:
- [ ] AWS ECS/EKS for container orchestration
- [ ] AWS ECR for Docker image registry
- [ ] S3 for static frontend assets only

## 4. Frontend Integration Tasks

### 4.1 API Integration
- [ ] Configure API endpoints in frontend application
- [ ] Set up environment variables for different deployment environments
- [ ] Implement authentication with JWT tokens

### 4.2 Deployment
- [ ] Deploy frontend to appropriate hosting service (S3 for static site)
- [ ] Configure CORS for API services
- [ ] Set up caching strategy

## 5. Additional Considerations

### 5.1 Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Configure centralized logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing

### 5.2 Security
- [ ] Secure Kubernetes secrets
- [ ] Implement network policies
- [ ] Configure TLS/SSL for all services

### 5.3 Scalability
- [ ] Configure horizontal pod autoscaling
- [ ] Implement database scaling strategy

## 6. Important Notes and Clarifications

1. **AWS S3 Limitation:** S3 is designed for static content hosting, not for running applications. For the microservices:
   - Use AWS EKS for container orchestration
   - Use ECR for storing Docker images
   - Use S3 only for frontend static assets

2. **Current Services:** The codebase includes User Service, Movie Catalog Service, Review Service, Recommendation Service, API Gateway, and Eureka Server.

3. **Architecture Decision:**
   - Keeping API Gateway and Eureka Server as part of the architecture
   - Using existing MongoDB Atlas cluster instead of containerizing MongoDB
